### Important notes

- Change the settings inside appsettings.json.

- The old migration files are inside /Data/Migrations but you don't need them.

- Delete the old migration files and run the migrations again to create the DB and table in your SQL Server.

- Without running the migrations it will not work because there will be No DB and No Tables.
